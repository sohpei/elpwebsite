                    <p class="gallery__description">My project was based around taking a picture a day, every single day. The purpose of this was threefold: first, to get myself more comfortable with using my phone in any situation, as it's something I can be quite self-conscious of; second, to create a daily log that wasn't a stereotypical written journal, and third, to create an attempt to notice and appreciate all aspects of the life around me. Through this, I really ended up (quite accidentally) focusing heavily on nature, with a secondary focus on my friends and family. It was an interesting learning experience about myself, to see what I pay attention to and am drawn towards, and I'm glad to have many of these photos now. It was also important for me to document every single day, because some of them were downright boring, and I think we all need a reminder every now and again that it's totally fine to have days where nothing happens, and that doesn't mean that day is wasted. While it's not a project that outwardly effects anyone else, I feel it was important for myself, and I definitely grew from this experience, and I would encourage others to try some personalized form of documenting and see what they learn about themselves from it.</p>
