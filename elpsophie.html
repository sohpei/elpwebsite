                    <p class="gallery__description">I remember visiting the <a href="about.html">Coves with Michelle, Azie, and Bridget</a>, and thinking: wow, this place is really special. And it's in London - the city where I was born, and where I now go to school - and I'd never heard of it until now. I wanted to make a practice that would help me identify this feeling of spatial dissonance. My original plan was to draw some pictures that I took when we went out to the Coves, but it felt strange to me to center my project around a place I had little connection to in my day-to-day life.
                        <br><br>
                        I chose to draw a piece of litter everyday, while imagining my work in the context of London at large. Western is notorious for being a "party school", and it's no secret that this is a huge contributor to its litter problem. Throughout my ELP, I explored my own identity as student in London - and a part of a population which often feels little responsibility to the community at large. Ultimately, I gained a deeper understanding of my own personal relationship to the anthropogenic and natural environment of London through this practice, and a somewhat more resolved relationship with the feeling of disorientation that I described feeling at the Coves. 
                        <br> <br>I had the privilege of exhibiting my work at the Satellite gallery alongside <a href="elpbridget.html">Bridget K.</a>, <a href="elpazadeh.html">Azie</a>, and <a href="elpshai.html">Shai</a>. The video and images shown here are from the exhibition.</p>
