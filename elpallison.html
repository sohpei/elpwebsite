					<p class="gallery__description">My ELP consists of a scrapbook that I made in documentation of various species of plants. I have an incredibly huge passion for plants, and I am fundamentally enthralled by the natural world - I think that it is so important for us to engage with the ‘more-than-human’ all around us. Plants are what I believe to be the pinnacle of all living things, connecting us to history, culture, health, and the environment. My scrapbook also contains botanical illustrations as well as poetry that I wrote based on natural objects that I found on nature walks; an assortment of these can be found below. Thanks so much for looking!</p>
