					<h3 class="gallery__author">MATTHEW DAWKINS</h3>
					<p class="gallery__description"> The aim of my Everyday Life Project, The Evolution of Mankind, as told by strangers, is to understand all the new ways people cope with the COVID-19 global pandemic and translate my observations of these new behaviours into poetry. Whereas many poems explore or investigate the human condition, I perceived our current global pandemic as a challenge to our human condition, that is the very way we experience life, and I wanted to take advantage of this window of time to record all the ways humanity sustains itself. In other words, despite the global pandemic and how we adapt to accommodate it, which themes of our humanity persist and fight to remain recognizable. It is the purpose of this project to capture all our norms and behaviours which last and delineate our attitudes towards, what I considered to be, a dystopian present.</p>

                        Neither of us have an umbrella<br>
                        And it is the second thing we have in common besides<br>
                        Sitting in this bus alone.<br><br>
                        
                        Together we watch the rain make something happen outside<br>
                        And we listen to it over the engine and ourselves,<br>
                        At least there is something taking place and it is not us<br><br>

                        The weather feels as special as fireworks, I suppose<br>
                        This time of year feels new.<br><br>

                        Are still looking out the window as if you expect a parade at the next stop. <br><br>
                        
                        The driver does not <br>

                        Long enough to realize our world is truly empty. <br>
                        Aside from us<br>
                        Aside from this bus<br>
                        There is little else happening<br>

                        twist it as close to your eyes as you want <br>
                        lost boys will never pay attention long enough to realize it.<br>
