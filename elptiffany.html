					<p class="gallery__description">Life can be boring, overwhelming, soul-crushing--the list goes on. Especially in light of everything that has happened in the year 2020, it's been incredibly difficult for so many of us to be able to find ways to be appreciative or positive. Speaking for myself as a post-secondary student, constantly bogged down with deadlines and grades, there were so many days when I didn't even have the will to climb out of bed. I knew that if I had kept pushing through blindly like I had, I probably wouldn't have been able to finish the semester. So I used this project as an opportunity to pay attention to the tiny beautiful moments of my days I would have normally missed and compiled it into a sketchbook.
