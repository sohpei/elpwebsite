                    <p class="gallery__description">This semester, we were tasked with a deliberately open-ended “Everyday Life Project.” Our assignment: to commit to a weekly practice with the goal of shifting our habits of attention. Beyond this minimal directive, the only guideline was to try to forge new connections between our daily lives and lives beyond own own. Such a guideline poses particular challenges in the context of a global pandemic, but the class has proved remarkably resourceful in creating community under constrained conditions.</p>
                    <p class="gallery__description">We anchored our projects in an area of London called “The Coves,” a tangled network of ponds, ravines, and trails that once served as a runoff for a paint factory. Within walking distance of the city centre, the Coves is a wilderness hiding in plain sight. We found an ideal guide through this unique ecosystem in Michelle Wilson, a PhD candidate in Visual Arts who is incorporating our work into a large-scale Coves community art project. Under Michelle’s guidance we became intimate with the Coves through a variety of hands-on practices: mapping trails, collecting and identifying plant specimens, picking up trash, harvesting and processing natural clay, and using phytoremediation techniques to clean up polluted soil, air and water.</p>
