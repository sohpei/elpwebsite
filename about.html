					<p class="gallery__description">This semester, we were tasked with a deliberately open-ended “Everyday Life Project.” Our assignment: to commit to a weekly practice with the goal of shifting our habits of attention. Beyond this minimal directive, the only guideline was to try to forge new connections between our daily lives and lives beyond own own.</p>
					<p class="gallery__description">Although each of our projects can stand as an individual work, they would not have been possible without the shared experiences that we were able to form throughout the semester. In spite of the constraints of the pandemic, our class was able to maintain a strong sense of community through grounding our own projects in a participatory and collective conversation. This page offers a look into some of the readings and opportunities which centered our dialogue.</p>
					<p class="gallery__description">We have each been exceptionally grateful to make something collaborative and unique out of our own everyday lives during a time when our everyday habits can seem both overwhelmingly surreal and mundane. <br><br>A special thanks to Professor Kate Stanley for facilitating and planning an amazing class. Our projects have all, in some form or another, been guided by her insight and warmth.<br><br>And thank you for taking the time to explore our practices.<br><br><i> - SASAH class of 2023</i></p>

Within walking distance of the city centre, the Coves is a wilderness hiding in plain sight. We found an ideal guide through this unique ecosystem in Michelle Wilson, a PhD candidate in Visual Arts who is incorporating our work into a large-scale Coves community art project. Under Michelle’s guidance we became intimate with the Coves through a variety of hands-on practices: mapping trails, collecting and identifying plant specimens, picking up trash, harvesting and processing natural clay, and using phytoremediation techniques to clean up polluted soil, air and water."</p>

						In that sense, the creek is a reminder that we do not live in a simulation—a streamlined world of products, results, experiences, reviews—but rather on a giant rock whose other life-forms operate according to an ancient, oozing, almost chthonic logic. Snaking through the midst of the banal everyday is a deep weirdness, a world of flowerings, decompositions, and seepages, of a million crawling things, of spores and lacy fungal filaments, of minerals reacting and things being eaten away—all just on the other side of the chain-link fence.
						</i></p>
					<p>" I
						believe that I am beginning to see the what exists “on the other side of the chain
						-
						link fence”
						(Odell 126), as she details, whereas before, all I saw
						was
						the chain
						-
						link fence. What I
						am most
						interested moving forward with my life, is to “suspend [my] tendency toward instrumental
						understanding [...] and instead sit with the unfathomable fact of their existence, which opens up
						toward us but can never be fully grasped or known” (104). In
						other words, I feel more prepared
						to navigate and shape my experience of interacting with my environment." <br><a href="elptiffany.html">-Tiffany Lin, My Happiness Project</a></p>
