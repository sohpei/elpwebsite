					<p class="gallery__description">Given all the ups and downs of the last year, we have all found it difficult to feel connected to the community around us. I wanted to use my ELP as a tool to mitigate this feeling of separation for myself and others and I decided to do so through music. Every day I set out to listen to a song I had never heard before suggested by a friend, family member, classmate, teammate, or acquaintance with the goal of expanding my musical taste and engineering a feeling of connectivity in my own life. Each day I reflected on the song I listened to focusing on the relationship I have with the person who suggested it, the production and lyrics of the song, and how it made me feel. Throughout this listening exercise, I learned a lot about my relationships and challenged myself to practice listening in many different ways. My eight weeks of listening culminated in a video in which I presented a condensed version of my project explained as five unique phases I experienced. Thanks for taking a look at the video and feel free to listen to my Community Playlist.</p>
